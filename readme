Based on https://launchpad.net/selenium-zoetrope under GNU LGPL v3.

Some features:
- Screenshots
- Video recording
- HTML report
- Mail report
- Unstable tests handling (can automaticly retry the job in Jenkins)

- Need some packages on the server:

    sudo apt-get install php-pear xvfb firefox
    sudo pear upgrade PEAR
    sudo pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com
    sudo pear channel-discover components.ez.no
    sudo pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    sudo pear install --alldeps --force phpunit/PHPUnit
    sudo pear install phpunit/PHPUnit_Selenium

- Add zoetrope as a sub module (example is putting Zoetrope in the tests folder)

    git submodule git://github.com/HNygard/selenium-zoetrope.git tests/zoetrope

- Make a copy of "seleniumstart.sh" into your repository.

    cp tests/zoetrope/seleniumstart.sh tests/seleniumstart.sh

- Edit URL for Jenkins etc in tests/seleniumstart.sh. Also remember to change things like include path. It should point
  to the class directory inside the zoetrope directory.

Jenkins setup:

- Install plugins

	Jenkins Text Finder (if you want to use unstable builds)


- Add a build step with shell execution and the following command:
	tests/seleniumstart.sh -u "http://path.to.your.site.example.com"

- Enable the plugin "Jenkins Text Finder"
	- Check "Also search the console output" and add the following expression
		Build state\: UNSTABLE
	- Check "Unstable if found"
- Enable "Publish HTML reports"
	- "HTML directory to archive": tests/zoetrope/results
	- "Index page[s]": result.html
	- "Report title": HTML Report
	- "Keep past HTML reports": checked
- Enable "Publish JUnit test result report"
	- "Test report XMLs": tests/zoetrope/results/*.xml
- Enable the plugin "Editable Email Notification"
	- Set "Project Recipient List" to your mailing list or just your email
	- "Default Content": ${FILE,path=tests/zoetrope/results/mail.html}
